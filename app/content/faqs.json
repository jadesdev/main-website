      "question": "How much does a project typically cost?",
      "answer": "Every project is unique, so we don't believe in one-size-fits-all pricing.

The final cost depends on the project's complexity, features, and timeline. The best way to get an accurate number is to schedule a free consultation with us, where we'll provide a detailed, no-obligation estimate based on your specific goals.",
